# Matching Game

This is my submission of the Memory Game Project for Udacity's Front End Nanodegree.

## Instructions

To Play the game, simply click on 1 of the 16 cards to reveal a symbol. Click on a second card to hopefully match that symbol. If the cards match then they stay revealed and the game continues until all cards have been matched. If they do not match then both cards will flip over and the game continues. At the end of the game you will be presented with your time to finish, the number of moves it took, and a rating of 1 to 3 stars to rank how well you did, 3 stars being a perfect game.
